#
# * BACKUP_TARGET_HOST
# * BACKUP_TARGET_PATH
# * BACKUP_SOURCE_PATH
#
# If BACKUP_SOURCE_HOST is given as well,
# we are backing up remote2remote,
# otherwise the default is to back up the  
# local data at BACKUP_SOURCE_PATH
#
# Second, we expect a working SSH connection
# (with keyfiles) between localhost and both 
# BACKUP_TARGET_HOST and BACKUP_SOURCE_HOST (if given).
# If given, the BACKUP_SOURCE_HOST will need to be
# able to connect to the BACKUP_TARGET_HOST, as well.
